## Introduction

This plugin is meant to make it easy to replace the background in portrait images and video.
It is using a neural network to predict the mask of the portrait and remove the background pixels.
It's easily composable with other OBS plugins to replace the background with e.g. an image or
a transparent color.

### Technical Details

GPU support:

- On Windows, we plan to support WinML acceleration.
- On Mac we support CoreML for acceleration, which is efficient on Apple Silicon. **Note:** This plugin does not support cross-architecture translation (Rosetta2). Intel binaries on Apple Silicon or Apple Silicon binaries on Intel will crash.
- On Linux CUDA and ROCM are supported if this plugin is built from source. Ensure your ONNX Runtime installation has CUDA or ROCM support.
- The goal of this plugin is to be available for everyone on every system, even if they don't own a GPU.

Number of CPU threads is controllable through the UI settings. A 2-thread setting works best.
